# REPL/playground for [prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier)

Official implementation suggested. Check out https://github.com/jlongster/prettier/pull/122

---

Set up a quick and dirty REPL based on the [Babel REPL](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io)
just to be able to play around with the awesome [prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier) package.

See live at: http://mib.im/try-prettier

This should be rewritten to actually be implemented properly, instead of just butchering existing code, but for now it works in the way that it allows me to test out prettier online.

## TODO

Lots of things.

- [x] Make it work
- [ ] Rewrite all
- [ ] Add options
- [ ] Design
- [ ] Don't butcher Babel code
